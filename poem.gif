Here's a simple Node.js program that outputs a short poem and a random number:

// poem-generator.js

// A short poem
const poem = `
Rays of sun and skies so blue,  
Dreams awaken, fresh and new.  
Leaves that dance in morning light,  
Hope and joy take gentle flight.  
`;

// Generate a random number between 1 and 100
const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;

// Output the poem and the random number
console.log(poem);
console.log(`Here's your random number: ${randomNumber}`);

To run it:

    Save the code as poem-generator.js.

    Run it in your terminal with:

node poem-generator.js

Let me know if you want it to generate a new poem every time or include themes!
